```
Compilation warnings/errors on contracts/vault_and_oracles/UniV3LpVault.sol:
Compiler error: Stack too deep when compiling inline assembly: Variable headStart is 1 slot(s) too deep inside the stack.
```


[04/06/2022 5:46 AM] 0v3rf10w
Any workaround?


[04/06/2022 5:57 AM] DramaOne#4728
what command is this from?


[04/06/2022 5:59 AM] DramaOne#4728
if from `hardhat coverage` take a look at https://github.com/sc-forks/solidity-coverage/blob/master/docs/faq.md#running-out-of-stack

otherwise if it's just from normal compiling, you can just reduce the number of optimizer runs in `hardhat.config.ts` (1 run is optimal for size)


[04/06/2022 6:01 AM] DramaOne#4728
i've also seen this from static analyzers like slither, in which case i would recommend running on the entire hardhat project where it can leverage optimizers, rather than just on a single file


[04/06/2022 6:02 AM] 0v3rf10w
nope just compiling `crytic-compile contracts/vault_and_oracles/UniV3LpVault.sol --solc-remaps @openzeppelin=$HOME/.nvm/versions/node/v16.13.0/lib/node_modules/@openzeppelin`
